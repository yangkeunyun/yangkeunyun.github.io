##### Abstract

In this paper, we investigate how civil service exams historically screened talent for bureaucrats and family lineages influenced their final appointments. We explore the Joseon Dynasty (1392 to 1897 CE) as an exemplary case that implemented the humanities examination (mun-gwa) in order to select candidates for high-ranking positions in the court. The kingdom’s comprehensive records on family ties and court official appointments over multiple centuries allow us to construct family network data with detailed information on individual exam scores and political careers. We find that the exam performance and family connections worked in tandem to select high-ranking officials. We find that top exam-scorers were more likely to become high-ranking officials, and that having illustrious family lineages, i.e. ancestors passing the exam or holding high-ranking official positions, also played a significant role in determining candidates’ political careers. Furthermore, we find that family lineages became especially important for official appointments during periods of political instability.

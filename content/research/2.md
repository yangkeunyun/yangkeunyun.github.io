description: "This paper examines overinvestment in groundwater pumping in California, where water utilities share aquifers but rarely coordinate to preserve them. We construct a panel dataset of water utilities’ production, pricing, surface and groundwater extraction, combined with measures of aquifer levels and underground supply sources. Using these data, we develop and estimate an empirical model of investment by regulated utilities."

##### Abstract

The overuse of open-access resources is a classic example of externalities. However, inefficiencies arise not only from resource use by existing market participants but also from their investment in capacity and the entry of new firms. Yet standard models of externalities typically abstract from firms’ entry, exit, and capital accumulation. This paper develops a model of strategic firm dynamics with production externalities, in which firms interact through stock depletion and congestion. I estimate the model using firm-level panel data from the American whaling industry (1804–1909), an unregulated global commons. Building on the estimated model, I quantify the shadow prices of externalities and introduce a tractable framework for optimal policy design. The results show that per-unit Pigouvian taxes alone cannot achieve the long-run social optimum, as they correct stock externalities but leave congestion and persistent overcapacity unaddressed. Optimal regulation combines per-unit taxes with state-dependent lump-sum taxes that vary by vessel capacity and productivity, fully internalizing firms’ dynamic interactions. The welfare effects of these policies depend critically on technology, demand, and resource regeneration, highlighting the importance of adaptive policy design.

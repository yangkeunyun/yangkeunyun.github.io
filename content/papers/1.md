##### Abstract

Inefficient resource allocation in unregulated commons poses classic economic issues. But limited evidence exists on how competitive entry, exit and investment shape market outcomes, although common-pool resources are characterized by open access and rivalry. This paper develops a dynamic model for resource exploitation and applies it to the 19th-century American whaling industry, a global commons for oil production. The analysis reveals a prevalent excess of players and capital compared to the efficient level. An optimal tax per whale achieves welfare gains comparable to those under a social planner and perfect collusion, thereby mitigating congestion and resource depletion. This study underscores the significance of the long-run industry structure in common-pool problems and the need for policies to alleviate externalities.

##### Abstract

Open-access commons attract excessive entry and investment, generating persistent inefficiencies. Existing models emphasize resource-use dynamics but abstract from firms’ entry, exit, and capital accumulation. This paper develops a model of strategic firm dynamics in which firms interact through congestion and stock depletion. I estimate the model using data from the 19th-century American whaling industry, an unregulated global commons. Building on the estimated model, I quantify shadow prices—the marginal external costs of firm behavior—and introduce a tractable framework for optimal policy design. The results show that Pigouvian per-unit taxes alone cannot achieve the long-run social optimum, as externalities arising from firms’ dynamic actions remain uncontrolled. When combined with state-dependent lump-sum fees, regulation directly targets the dynamic forces that distort resource allocation across firms and over time. The welfare effects of these policies vary substantially with technology, demand, and resource regeneration, underscoring the need for adaptive regulation.

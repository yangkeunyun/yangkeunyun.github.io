##### Abstract

Rising competition in the commons poses risks of resource depletion and congestion, yet it can lower markups and increase consumer welfare. Conversely, larger, longer-lived firms tend to internalize externalities but also limit production and raise prices. To balance these competing concerns, this paper develops a model of common-pool industry dynamics and applies it to the 19th-century American whaling industry. The findings suggest that the industry over-harvested whales in the early periods, leading to inefficient production later on. A monopoly firm partially mitigates these inefficiencies, but it would reduce harvesting more than a social planner who maximizes social welfare. The optimal Pigouvian tax that fully internalizes the shadow values of whaling can achieve a socially efficient allocation.

##### Abstract

Rising competition in the commons poses risks of resource depletion and congestion. This paper develops a dynamic empirical model to identify the drivers of excessive entry and investment, along with low rates of exit and divestment. Using data from the American whaling industry, the estimated model reveals that uncoordinated behaviors of whaling firms caused welfare losses of 40% over the century. Perfect collusion could have reduced inefficiencies through internalizing externalities, but it would still result in a suboptimal allocation due to higher prices and lower consumer welfare. Derived from the social plannerâ€™s first-best allocation, an optimal tax policy would have prevented the tragedy of the commons while minimizing distortions from market power.

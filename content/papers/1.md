##### Abstract

This paper investigates strategic industry dynamics in common-pool resources. Theories predict that competitive participation and capitalization lead to external diseconomies over time. Rising market prices, resulting from cost increases, would further incentivize these tendencies. To analyze these economic forces, I estimate a dynamic model using data from the American whaling industry. Leveraging the estimated model parameters, I quantify the welfare loss in comparison to the optimal outcome of a social planner and evaluate various counterfactual policies.

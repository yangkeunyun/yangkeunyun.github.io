##### Abstract

Rising competition in the commons poses risks of resource depletion and congestion, yet it can lower markups and increase consumer welfare. Larger, longer-lived firms tend to internalize more of the externalities but also raise prices. To balance these competing concerns, this paper develops a model of common-pool industry dynamics and applies it to the 19th-century American whaling industry. The findings suggest that the industry harvested more whales in early periods compared to a counterfactual monopolistic scenario. This overproduction led to decline in whale stocks, reducing production and increasing prices in later periods. A Pigouvian tax that fully internalizes the shadow values of whaling could have achieved a socially efficient allocation.

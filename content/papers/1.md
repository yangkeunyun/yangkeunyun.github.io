##### Abstract

Competitive entry and investment in the commons can lead to resource depletion and congestion externalities. But little evidence exists on the efficient allocation of common-pool resources over the long run. This paper develops a model of common-pool industry dynamics and applies it to the 19th-century American whaling industry, a global commons for oil production. The estimated model reveals welfare loses due to a prevailing excess of players and capital compared to the first-best outcome. To  design corrective policies, counterfactual simulation quantifies the shadow values of whaling. A Pigouvian tax that fully internalizes the externality resulting from excessive competition would have achieved a socially efficient allocation.

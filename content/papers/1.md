##### Abstract

Rising competition in the commons poses risks of resource depletion and congestion, yet it can lower markups and increase consumer welfare. Conversely, larger, longer-lived firms tend to internalize externalities but also restrict production and raise prices. To navigate these competing concerns, this paper develops a model of common-pool industry dynamics and applies it to the 19th-century American whaling industry. The findings suggest that the industry over-harvested whales in early periods, subsequently making production inefficient. A monopoly firm would have reduced harvesting more than a social planner who maximizes social welfare. The optimal Pigouvian tax that fully internalizes the shadow values of whaling could have achieved a socially efficient allocation.

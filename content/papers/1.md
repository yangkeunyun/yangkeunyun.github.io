##### Abstract

Common-pool resources exhibit open access and rivalry. This results in inefficient resource allocation due to unrestricted participation and production inputs. However, limited evidence exists on how competitive entry, exit and investment shape market outcomes in the commons. This paper develops a dynamic empirical framework for resource exploitation and applies it to the 19th-century American whaling industryâ€”a global commons for oil production. The analysis reveals a prevailing excess of players and capital input compared to the efficient level. To mitigate congestion and resource depletion,  implementing an optimal tax per whale yields welfare gains comparable to those realized under a social planner and perfect collusion. Policy interventions that overlook the long-run industry structure lead to suboptimal allocation.

##### Abstract

Rising competition in the commons poses risks of resource depletion and congestion. This paper develops an empirical model of common-pool industry dynamics to identify the evolution of competition structure with resource transitions. Using data from the 19th-century American whaling industry, the estimated model reveals that uncoordinated behaviors of whaling firms caused substantial welfare losses over a century. Perfect collusion could have reduced inefficiencies through internalizing externalities, but it would still result in a suboptimal allocation due to higher markups. Derived from the social plannerâ€™s problem, a tax policy would have prevented the tragedy of the commons while minimizing distortions from market power.

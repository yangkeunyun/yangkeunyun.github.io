##### Abstract

Economic theories predict that unregulated access and capitalization lead to negative externalities in common-pool resources. However, limited empirical evidence exists regarding how open access impacts competition structure and associated inefficiencies. This study addresses this gap by developing a dynamic model applied to data from the American whaling industry.  The results indicate that competitive entry, investment, and exit at the micro-level resulted in a significant welfare loss compared to a social planner's optimal outcome. Furthermore, endogenous market price and resource stock dynamics exacerbate these tendencies. This paper demonstrates that implementing a differentiated Pigouvian tax, accounting for individual heterogeneity, can lead to substantial welfare improvements.

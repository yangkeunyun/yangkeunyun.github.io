##### Abstract

Open-access commons often suffer from excessive entry and investment, leading to persistent inefficiencies. Yet most models of common-pool resources abstract from firm dynamics, even though unrestricted entry, exit, and investment can amplify externalities. This paper develops a model of firm dynamics in which firms strategically interact through congestion and stock depletion. I estimate the model using data from the 19th-century American whaling industry, an unregulated global commons. Simulating the estimated model, I propose a tractable framework for designing optimal regulation in complex, real-world settings. Results show that per-unit taxes alone cannot jointly regulate harvest levels and industry structure. When paired with state-dependent lump-sum fees, the policy internalizes externalities from the mix of firm sizes and productivities, aligning private incentives with social costs. Welfare effects vary substantially with technology, demand, and whale regeneration, underscoring the need for adaptable regulation.

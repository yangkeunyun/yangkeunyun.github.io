##### Abstract

This paper studies strategic industry dynamics in common-pool resources. Theories predict that competitive entry and investments contribute to external diseconomies over time, reducing aggregate supply. As a result of supply deficits, rising market prices incentivize delayed exit and divestment. To analyze these economic forces, I estimate a dynamic model using data from the American whaling industry, renowned for its historical significance in oil production. By leveraging the estimated model parameters, I quantify the welfare loss in comparison to a social planner's optimal outcome and evaluate various counterfactual policies.

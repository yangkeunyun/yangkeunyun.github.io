##### Abstract

Rising competition in the commons poses risks of resource depletion and congestion. Conversely, larger, longer-lived firms tend to internalize more of these externalities but at the expense of higher markups. To navigate these competing concerns, this paper develops a model of industry dynamics and applies it to the 19th-century American whaling industry. The findings show that a policy designed based on the heterogeneous shadow values for whaling achieves a socially efficient allocation. This policy leads to the emergence of a few dominant firms alongside many fringe firms, effectively balancing the trade-offs between the tragedy of the commons and market power.

##### Abstract

Competitive entry and investment in the commons can lead to resource depletion and congestion. But little evidence exists on the efficient allocation of common-pool resources in the long run. This paper develops a model of common-pool industry dynamics and applies it to the 19th-century American whaling industry, a global commons for oil production. The estimated model reveals welfare losses due to a prevailing excess of players and capital compared to the first-best outcome. Counterfactual simulation quantifies the shadow values of whaling to design corrective policies. A Pigouvian tax that fully internalizes increasing competition over time achieves a socially efficient allocation.

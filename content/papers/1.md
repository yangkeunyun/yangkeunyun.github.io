##### Abstract

Rising competition in the commons poses risks of resource depletion and congestion. Conversely, larger, longer-lived firms tend to internalize more of these externalities but at the expense of higher markups. To navigate these competing concerns, this paper develops a model of industry dynamics and applies it to the 19th-century American whaling industry. A notable finding is that identifying the heterogeneous shadow values for whaling across firms over time is key to organizing an optimal market structure. A differentiated Pigouvian tax leads a few dominant firms to prevent the tragedy of the commons, while many fringe firms balance market power.

##### Abstract

Inefficient resource allocation in unregulated commons arises from open access and rivalry. But limited evidence exists on how competitive entry, exit and investment shape market outcomes in common-pool resources. This paper develops a dynamic model for resource exploitation and applies it to the 19th-century American whaling industryâ€”a global commons for oil production. The analysis reveals a prevailing excess of players and capital input compared to the efficient level. As a remedy to congestion and resource depletion externalities, an optimal tax per whale achieves welfare gains comparable to those under a social planner and perfect collusion. This study underscores the significance of the long-run industry structure in common-pool problems.

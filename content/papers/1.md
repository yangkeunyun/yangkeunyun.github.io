##### Abstract

Rising competition in the commons poses risks of resource depletion and congestion, yet it can lower markups and increase consumer welfare. Conversely, larger, longer-lived firms tend to internalize externalities but also restrict production and raise prices. To navigate these competing concerns, this paper develops a model of common-pool industry dynamics and applies it to the 19th-century American whaling industry. The findings suggest that the industry harvested more whales in early periods than it would have under a monopoly counterfactual. This overproduction led to a decline in whale stocks, subsequently reducing production and increasing prices in later periods. A social planner, on the other hand, would have balanced consumer and producer surpluses to maximize social welfare. A Pigouvian tax that fully internalizes the shadow values of whaling could have achieved a socially efficient allocation.

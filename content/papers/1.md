##### Abstract

Economic theories predict that unrestricted access and capitalization can lead to negative externalities in common-pool resources. However, limited empirical evidence exists regarding the influence of open access on competition structure and associated inefficiencies. This study addresses this gap by developing a dynamic model applied to data from the American whaling industry. The estimated results show that strategic interactions trigger the race for resources while delaying the industry shakeout, and endogenous market prices exacerbate these tendencies. This paper demonstrates that implementing a differentiated Pigouvian tax, considering individual heterogeneity, can result in significant welfare improvements.

##### Abstract

This paper develops a model of firm dynamics in common-pool resources to investigate long-run market inefficiencies. Firms strategically enter, exit, and invest while accounting for resource dynamics and evolving industry conditions. These actions create congestion and stock externalities, which individual firms have no incentive to internalize. The model is estimated using long-panel data from the 19th-century American whaling industry, an unregulated global commons for oil and bone production. Counterfactual simulations show that the observed market allocation resulted in a deadweight loss of \$3.7 billion in 2024 dollars, representing 30 percent of the first-best social welfare. A collusive monopoly would produce larger welfare losses, as higher markups outweigh gains from internalizing externalities. The welfare impacts vary significantly with changes in demand and technological progress.

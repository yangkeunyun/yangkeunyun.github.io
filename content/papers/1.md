##### Abstract

This paper studies strategic industry dynamics in common-pool resources. Theoretical predictions suggest that competitive participation and capitalization result in negative externalities, ultimately reducing supply over time. The escalation of market prices, driven by supply deficits, further reinforce these inefficiencies. To analyze these economic forces, this study builds a dynamic model and estimates it using data from the American whaling industry. Leveraging the estimated model parameters, I quantify the welfare loss in comparison to the optimal outcome of a social planner and evaluate various counterfactual policies.

##### Abstract

Rising competition in the commons poses risks of resource depletion and congestion. This study develops an empirical model to investigate how firm dynamics in common-pool resources contribute to industry inefficiencies. Using data from the 19th-century American whaling industry, the estimated model reveals that uncoordinated whaling firms caused substantial welfare losses over a century. Perfect collusion could have internalized externalities, but welfare gains would be partially offset by lower consumer surplus due to higher markups. A per-whale tax, derived from the social plannerâ€™s problem, would have prevented the tragedy of the commons while minimizing distortions from market power.

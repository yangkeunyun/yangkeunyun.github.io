##### Abstract

Common-pool resources exhibit open access and rivalry, leading to competitive entry, exit, and investment. Increased participation and utilization of production inputs can cause congestion and depletion of resource stocks. Yet, little evidence exists on the efficient allocation of resources in the commons over the long run when industry structure is flexible. This paper develops a model of common-pool industry dynamics and applies it to the 19th-century American whaling industry, a global commons for oil production. The analysis reveals a prevailing excess of players and capital compared to the first-best allocation. As a remedy for congestion and resource depletion, optimal tax policy achieves a sizable welfare gain. However, policies that overlook the long-run industry structure deliver lower welfare improvements.

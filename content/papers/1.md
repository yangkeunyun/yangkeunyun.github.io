##### Abstract

Open-access commons attract excessive entry and investment, generating persistent inefficiencies. Existing models emphasize resource-use dynamics but often abstract from firmsâ€™ entry, exit, and capital accumulation. This paper develops a model of strategic firm dynamics with production externalities, in which firms interact through both congestion and stock depletion. I estimate the model using data from the 19th-century American whaling industry, an unregulated global commons. Building on the estimated model, I quantify the shadow prices of externalities and introduce a tractable framework for optimal policy design. The results show that per-unit Pigouvian taxes alone cannot achieve the long-run social optimum, as they correct only stock externalities while leaving congestion externalities unaddressed.  Optimal regulation combines per-unit taxes with state-dependent lump-sum fees to target the dynamic forces that distort resource allocation across firms and over time. The welfare effects of these policies vary substantially with technology, demand, and resource regeneration, highlighting the importance of adaptive policy design.

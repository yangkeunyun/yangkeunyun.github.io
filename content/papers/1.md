##### Abstract

This paper investigates inefficiencies in the exploitation of common-pool resources, where the market structure evolves endogenously. Theoretical predictions indicate that competitive participation and capitalization lead to negative externalities, which in turn diminish the supply over time. The subsequent rise in market prices, driven by supply deficits, further incentivizes these tendencies. To analyze these economic forces, this study builds a dynamic model and estimates it using data from the American whaling industry. Leveraging the estimated model parameters, counterfactual experiments quantify the welfare loss in comparison to the optimal outcome of a social planner and evaluate various market-based regulations.

##### Abstract

This paper develops a dynamic empirical framework to evaluate markets for common-pool resources under open access. The model is applied to long-panel data from the 19th-century American whaling industry, an unregulated global commons for oil and bone production. Estimation results reveal that high sunk costs of entry and investment delayed exit and divestment, leading to more firms and vessels than socially optimal. Counterfactual simulations suggest welfare losses of 40% over a century compared to a social planner's benchmark.

##### Abstract

Rising competition in the commons poses risks of resource depletion and congestion. Conversely, consolidation by larger, longer-lived firms tends to internalize externalities, but this can result in higher markups and reduced consumer welfare. To navigate these competing concerns, this paper develops a model of common-pool industry dynamics and applies it to the 19th-century American whaling industry. The findings suggest that the industry over-harvested whales in the early periods, leading to inefficient production later on. A monopoly could have partially mitigated these inefficiencies, but it would have reduced harvesting more than a social planner would. The optimal Pigouvian tax that fully internalizes the shadow values of whaling could have achieved a socially efficient allocation.

##### Abstract

Common-pool resources exhibit open access and rivalry, leading to unrestricted participation and production inputs. But little evidence exists on how competitive entry, exit and investment shape market outcomes in the commons. This paper develops a dynamic empirical framework for quantifying common-pool externalities. I apply it to the 19th-century American whaling industry, a global commons for oil production. The analysis reveals a prevailing excess of players and capital compared to the first-best allocation. As a remedy for congestion and resource depletion, optimal taxation per whale achieves a sizable welfare gain. However, policies that overlook the long-run industry structure deliver lower welfare improvements.

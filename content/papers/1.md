##### Abstract

This paper examines long‚Äêrun resource allocation in the commons. Firms strategically enter, exit, and invest while accounting for resource dynamics and changing market conditions. These actions generate congestion and stock depletion that individual firms have no incentive to internalize. I estimate the model using data from the 19th-century American whaling industry, an unregulated global commons. I then introduce a framework that sets policy instruments equal to marginal social damages at the efficient allocation. Results show that combining Pigouvian per-unit taxes with lump-sum license fees achieves the long-run social optimum. In contrast, a single instrument cannot jointly regulate harvest levels and industry structure. Welfare effects vary substantially with technology, demand, and whale regeneration.

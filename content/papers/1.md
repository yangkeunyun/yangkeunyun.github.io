##### Abstract

Rising competition in the commons poses risks of resource depletion and congestion. Conversely, larger, longer-lived firms tend to internalize more of these externalities, but at the expense of higher markups. To navigate these competiting concerns, this paper develops a model of industry dynamics and applies it to the 19th-century American whaling industry. The results suggest that a differentiated Pigouvian tax, designed based on the shadow values of whaling, could have achieved a socially efficient allocation. This study highlights that identifying the perceived values of resources across firms over time is key to organizing an optimal market structure for managing the commons.

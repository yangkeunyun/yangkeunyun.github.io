##### Abstract

This paper develops a dynamic model to study long-run resource allocation in the commons. Firms strategically enter, exit, and invest while accounting for resource dynamics and changing market conditions. These actions generate congestion and stock depletion that individual firms have no incentive to internalize. I estimate the model using data from the 19th-century American whaling industry, an unregulated global commons for oil and bone production. I then introduce a fixed-point framework that sets policy instruments equal to marginal social damages at the efficient allocation---without solving the plannerâ€™s problem. Using this framework, I find that combining Pigouvian per-unit taxes with lump-sum license fees achieves the long-run social optimum. In contrast, a single instrument fails to jointly control harvest levels and industry structure. Welfare implications vary significantly with changes in demand, technology, and whale regeneration.

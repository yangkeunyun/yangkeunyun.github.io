##### Abstract

Competitive entry and investment in the commons can result in congestion and resource depletion. But little evidence exists on the efficient allocation of common-pool resources when industry structure is flexible over the long run. This paper develops a model of common-pool industry dynamics and applies it to the 19th-century American whaling industry, a global commons for oil production. The analysis reveals a prevailing excess of players and capital compared to the first-best allocation. By using estimated shadow values, optimal tax policies are identified to address negative externalities. The findings underscore the importance of considering long-run industry structure when designing policies to achieve efficient outcomes.

##### Abstract

Economic theories predict that unrestricted access and capitalization can lead to negative externalities in common-pool resources. However, limited empirical evidence exists regarding how open access influences competition structure and its associated inefficiencies. This study addresses this gap by developing a dynamic model applied to data from the American whaling industry. The estimated cost structure reveals an asymmetryâ€”entry and investment are easier than exit and divestment. Two primary factors contribute to this asymmetry. First, strategic interactions trigger the race to fish while delaying the industry shakeout. Second, endogenous market prices exacerbate these tendencies. This paper demonstrates that implementing a differentiated Pigouvian tax, considering individual heterogeneity, can result in significant welfare improvements.
